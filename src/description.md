A Java application built with the Spring Framework and JPA (Java Persistence API) typically involves creating a web application that interacts with a relational database. The Spring Framework provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, while JPA is used for mapping Java objects to database tables.

Key Components
Spring Boot: Simplifies the setup and development of new Spring applications with embedded servers and pre-configured settings.
Spring Data JPA: Provides easy integration with JPA, allowing for repository-based data access layers.
Entities: Java classes annotated with JPA annotations to represent database tables.
Repositories: Interfaces extending JpaRepository to handle CRUD operations.
Service Layer: Contains business logic and interacts with repositories.
Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and map them to service methods.
